# Biography
I am a Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Psychology at [Keele University, UK](https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/), where I am also currently serving as Head of School. I joined Keele in 2010 after completing my PhD at Bangor University under the supervision of [Dr George Houghton.](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/george_houghton.php.en)

The mission of my lab's work is to conduct fundamental research to understand cognitive control processes, and to then use this knowledge to tackle applied and clinical questions.
