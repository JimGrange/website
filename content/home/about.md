# Biography
Test I am a Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Psychology at [Keele University, UK](https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/), where I am also currently serving as interim Head of School. I joined Keele in 2010 after completing my PhD at Bangor University under the supervision of [Dr George Houghton.](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/george_houghton.php.en)

I primarily teach research methods & statistics. My research interests are centered on three interlinked topics: (1) Cognitive control processes, both at a basic and an applied level; (2) Application & development of computational cognitive models; and (3) Issues surrounding reproducibility and replication in psychological science.
