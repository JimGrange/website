A reviewer has asked myself and my co-author to conduct some additional analysis using latent change score modelling for a computational cognitive modelling paper we have submitted. As I have absolutely no idea how to conduct any form of structural equation modelling, I am asking the universe (i.e., you!) for help.

If you can help, [please do reach out](https://www.jimgrange.org/#contact). 

I am conducting all analysis in R, so will be looking to use the (seemingly excellent) [lavaan package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/index.html). 
 
I will provide a quick overview of the paper's contribution, before outlining the SEM model requested by the reviewer.

## Overview of Paper
We have a computational cognitive model that when fit to human response time data provides me with three independent parameters, labelled $a$, $v$, and $t0$. I fit the cognitive model to two experimental conditions. Let's call  these "easy" and "hard" conditions. This then provides 6 parameter values for each participant:

* $a_{easy}$
* $a_{hard}$
* $v_{easy}$
* $v_{hard}$
* $t0_{easy}$
* $t0_{hard}$

When we calculate difference scores—which we call delta ($\Delta$)—for each parameter by subtracting the easy parameter value from the hard parameter value:

* $\Delta_{a} = a_{hard} - a_{easy}$
* $\Delta_{v} = v_{hard} - v_{easy}$
* $\Delta_{t0} = t0_{hard} - t0_{easy}$

Our paper reports a spurious correlation that emerges between $\Delta_{a}$ and $\Delta_{t0}$, something which shouldn’t occur according to the theory we are modelling. We have a preprint on this effect here: [https://psyarxiv.com/u6py8](https://psyarxiv.com/u6py8).

## Reviewer's Request
The reviewer suggested we attempt to model the correlation between the difference scores at the latent level using latent change score modelling.

The reviewer's exact wording is:

> “An alternative would be to use latent change models to regress model estimates from the hard condition on the easier condition and to then correlate latent changes score of the a-parameter and the t0 parameters”

From my understanding of this request, we could do the following:

* First, split the human trial-level data into "odd" and "even" trials in both the easy and the hard conditions. (Each participant had 1,000 trials in total.)
* Second, fit the cognitive model separately to odd and even trials for both easy and hard conditions.
* Use these as "manifest variables" in an SEM to create latent variables for each parameter for each condition. For example, estimate a latent variable $a_{easy}$ from the manifest variables $a_{easy(odd)}$ and $a_{easy(even)}$.
* Then, have latent variables reflecting the *difference* between the latent variables between experimental conditions:
  * $\Delta_{a} = a_{hard} - a_{easy}$
  * $\Delta_{v} = v_{hard} - v_{easy}$
  * $\Delta_{t0} = t0_{hard} - t0_{easy}$
* Then, we are interested in the relationship between $\Delta_{a}$ and $\Delta_{t0}$. .

From this description, I've knocked up a quick visual of what I think this model looks like (but forgive lack of accuracy in any deviations from how these models are traditionally presented).

## My Questions
So, I basically have two questions that we would *really* apprecitate some help on:

* Is this model properly specified (i.e., can we get the type of analysis we want from the data we have?)?
  - (To my admittedly naiive mind, we don't seem to have enough manifest variables to create so many latent variables, but maybe SEM is much more magic than I thought!)
* How on earth does one create such a model in lavaan? Are there any examples of these types of models with open-source code you could provide? Or any helpful resources to help get started with this?

## Fake Data

Here's some fake data with the same structure as my real data:

```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# sample size 
n <- 500

data <- tibble(
  a_easy_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1), 
  a_easy_even= rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  a_hard_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  a_hard_even = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  v_easy_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1), 
  v_easy_even= rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  v_hard_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  v_hard_even = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  t0_easy_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1), 
  t0_easy_even= rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  t0_hard_odd = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
  t0_hard_even = rnorm(n, 0, 1)
)

head(data)
```
