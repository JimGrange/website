<p>A reviewer has asked myself and my co-author to conduct some additional analysis using latent change score modelling for a computational cognitive modelling paper we have submitted. As I have absolutely no idea how to conduct any form of structural equation modelling, I am asking the universe (i.e., you!) for help.</p>
<p>If you can help, <a href="https://www.jimgrange.org/#contact">please do reach out</a>.</p>
<p>I am conducting all analysis in R, so will be looking to use the (seemingly excellent) <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/index.html">lavaan package</a>.</p>
<p>I will provide a quick overview of the paper’s contribution, before outlining the SEM model requested by the reviewer.</p>

<h2>Overview of Paper</h2>
<p>We have a computational cognitive model that when fit to human response time data provides me with three independent parameters, labelled <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t0\)</span>. I fit the cognitive model to two experimental conditions. Let’s call these “easy” and “hard” conditions. This then provides 6 parameter values for each participant:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a_{hard}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_{hard}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(t0_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(t0_{hard}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When we calculate difference scores—which we call delta (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>)—for each parameter by subtracting the easy parameter value from the hard parameter value:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{a} = a_{hard} - a_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{v} = v_{hard} - v_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{t0} = t0_{hard} - t0_{easy}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our paper reports a spurious correlation that emerges between <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{t0}\)</span>, something which shouldn’t occur according to the theory we are modelling. We have a preprint on this effect here: <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/u6py8">https://psyarxiv.com/u6py8</a>.</p>

<div id="reviewers-request" class="section level2">
<h2>Reviewer’s Request</h2>
<p>The reviewer suggested we attempt to model the correlation between the difference scores at the latent level using latent change score modelling.</p>
<p>The reviewer’s exact wording is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An alternative would be to use latent change models to regress model estimates from the hard condition on the easier condition and to then correlate latent changes score of the a-parameter and the t0 parameters”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my understanding of this request, we could do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, split the human trial-level data into “odd” and “even” trials in both the easy and the hard conditions. (Each participant had 1,000 trials in total.)</li>
<li>Second, fit the cognitive model separately to odd and even trials for both easy and hard conditions.</li>
<li>Use these as “manifest variables” in an SEM to create latent variables for each parameter for each condition. For example, estimate a latent variable <span class="math inline">\(a_{easy}\)</span> from the manifest variables <span class="math inline">\(a_{easy(odd)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{easy(even)}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Then, have latent variables reflecting the <em>difference</em> between the latent variables between experimental conditions:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{a} = a_{hard} - a_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{v} = v_{hard} - v_{easy}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{t0} = t0_{hard} - t0_{easy}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then, we are interested in the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{t0}\)</span>. .</li>
</ul>
<p>From this description, I’ve knocked up a quick visual of what I think this model looks like (but forgive lack of accuracy in any deviations from how these models are traditionally presented).</p>

<div id="my-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>My Questions</h2>
<p>So, I basically have two questions that we would <em>really</em> apprecitate some help on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this model properly specified (i.e., can we get the type of analysis we want from the data we have?)?
<ul>
<li>(To my admittedly naiive mind, we don’t seem to have enough manifest variables to create so many latent variables, but maybe SEM is much more magic than I thought!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How on earth does one create such a model in lavaan? Are there any examples of these types of models with open-source code you could provide? Or any helpful resources to help get started with this?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some fake data with the same structure as my real data:</p>
