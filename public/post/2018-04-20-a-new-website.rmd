I have spent the past day or so transporting my acedemic website from [Wordpress](https://jimgrange.wordpress.com) to the current website, which is written using the (superb!) [R package 'blogdown'](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I made the change for a variety of reasons:

* I am now able to use R for *most* things---analysis, simulations, writing papers using [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) and now my website---making my workflow more efficient (and high on the nerd-scale).

* I could never really get my wordpress site to look sleek and professional. Using R and blogdown I was able to utilise the [Hugo website templates](https://themes.gohugo.io/), which look very nice. (The current versio of my website uses the [Hugo Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).) 

* As the blog is written in R and blogdown, it means that all the content & code behind it can be made freely available. You can see the Github page for the code of my website [here](https://github.com/JimGrange/website).

* The blog posts on my previous site which I enjoyed writing the most had R demonstrations in them. As blogdown uses markdown, I can now write blog posts using markdown meaning I can integrate R code into the blog post! Not just that, plots are automatically integrated into the blog! Observe thus!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = density)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
```


What other reasons did I need?
