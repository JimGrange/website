      <description>The bookdown book package just arrived at my door. Love the Alegreya &amp;amp; Source Code Pro fonts on paper. Also happy that the book is so thin! pic.twitter.com/kr21J19Cw1

      <description>In 2015, I published my first ever R package: “trimr: An implementation of common response time trimming methods”. To date, this package has had over 5,600 downloads from CRAN, which is unbelievable!
3 years is a long time for a package, so I thought it was time to update the package, fix some bugs, and implement some additional functionality. To this end, I have spent some time over the past few days working on a new release.</description>

      <description>I have spent the past day or so transporting my acedemic website from Wordpress to the current website, which is written using the (superb!) R package ‘blogdown’.
I made the change for a variety of reasons:
 I am now able to use R for most things—analysis, simulations, writing papers using papaja and now my website—making my workflow more efficient (and high on the nerd-scale).
 I could never really get my wordpress site to look sleek and professional.</description>
