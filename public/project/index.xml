      <description>Current Projects: Task Switching
Memory &amp;amp; Cognitive Control
Task Switching Humans live in an increasingly busy, multi-task environment which often requires frequent switching between different cognitive operations and tasks. Driving, for example, presents us with an incredibly complex environment wherein many sub-tasks&amp;mdash;e.g. speed monitoring, interpretation of abstract road signs, planning the best route etc.&amp;mdash;must be organised and deployed appropriately in order to arrive at our destination safely. Yet, despite the complexity, humans are able to act efficiently in a goal-directed manner.</description>

      <description>The ultimate goal in the field of cognitive science/psychology is to understand the workings of the human/animal mind. How do we selectively attend to goal-relevant stimuli? How do we remember such vast amounts of information? How do we plan and co-ordinate complex plans of action? Researchers address these problems by describing behaviour, through observation and experimentation. At a higher level, researchers aim to predict behaviour: Only a solid understanding of a phenomenon allows successful prediction of future behaviour in differing contexts.</description>

      <description>Much of our work has focussed on basic questions on cognitive psychology. More recently, we have shifted our attention to some more applied questions. It is our aim to increase our focus on this line of research. We aim to utilise the findings from our basic research programme to probe cognition in clinical and ageing populations.

      <description>Replication is the most important statistic. If an experimental effect does not replicateóeither in your own lab or independentlyóthen trust in that effect should rightly diminish. Thus, assessing the reproducibility of an effect should rightly be among the priorities of psychological scientists. Despite the importance, replication attempts in psychology are rare, likely due to the enhanced incentive (e.g. publications, grant income) to introduce new ideas to the field rather than assess the validity of old ones.</description>
