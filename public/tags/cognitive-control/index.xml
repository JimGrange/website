      <description>Current Projects: Task Switching
Memory &amp;amp; Cognitive Control
Task Switching Humans live in an increasingly busy, multi-task environment which often requires frequent switching between different cognitive operations and tasks. Driving, for example, presents us with an incredibly complex environment wherein many sub-tasks&amp;mdash;e.g. speed monitoring, interpretation of abstract road signs, planning the best route etc.&amp;mdash;must be organised and deployed appropriately in order to arrive at our destination safely. Yet, despite the complexity, humans are able to act efficiently in a goal-directed manner.</description>

      <description>Much of our work has focussed on basic questions on cognitive control processes. More recently, we have shifted our attention (pun intended!) to applying the knowledge gained from this basic research towards clinical and applied questions. To date, we have conducted research on cognition in Healthy Ageing (Grange &amp;amp; Becker, 2019), depression (Grange, 2022; Grange &amp;amp; Rydon-Grange, 2020), and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease (Martini et al., 2018).
Much of the clinical and applied work we conduct utilises computational modelling to quantify (potential) disruption to latent cognitive processes in clinical populations.</description>
