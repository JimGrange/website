      <description>Current Projects: Task Switching
Memory &amp;amp; Cognitive Control
Task Switching Humans live in an increasingly busy, multi-task environment which often requires frequent switching between different cognitive operations and tasks. Driving, for example, presents us with an incredibly complex environment wherein many sub-tasks&amp;mdash;e.g. speed monitoring, interpretation of abstract road signs, planning the best route etc.&amp;mdash;must be organised and deployed appropriately in order to arrive at our destination safely. Yet, despite the complexity, humans are able to act efficiently in a goal-directed manner.</description>

      <description>Much of our work has focussed on basic questions on cognitive psychology. More recently, we have shifted our attention to some more applied questions, and it is our aim to increase our focus on this line of research. We aim to utilise the findings from our basic research programme to probe cognition in clinical and ageing populations.
