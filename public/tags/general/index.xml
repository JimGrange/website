      <description>Today marks my 10 year anniversary of working at Keele University. On the one hand it feels like a blink of an eye, and yet on the other a lifetime. (Well, as I am 38 years old, a quarter of a lifetime.)
I started my lectureship in Psychology at Keele on the 1st July 2010, 3 weeks before I obtained my PhD. Imposter syndrome was—and still is—alive and well.</description>

      <description>I have spent the past day or so transporting my acedemic website from Wordpress to the current website, which is written using the (superb!) R package ‘blogdown’.
I made the change for a variety of reasons:
 I am now able to use R for most things—analysis, simulations, writing papers using papaja and now my website—making my workflow more efficient (and high on the nerd-scale).
 I could never really get my wordpress site to look sleek and professional.</description>
