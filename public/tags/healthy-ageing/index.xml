      <description>Much of our work has focussed on basic questions on cognitive control processes. More recently, we have shifted our attention (pun intended!) to applying the knowledge gained from this basic research towards clinical and applied questions. To date, we have conducted research on cognition in Healthy Ageing (Grange &amp;amp; Becker, 2019), depression (Grange, 2022; Grange &amp;amp; Rydon-Grange, 2020), and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease (Martini et al., 2018).
Much of the clinical and applied work we conduct utilises computational modelling to quantify (potential) disruption to latent cognitive processes in clinical populations.</description>
