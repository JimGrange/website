      <description>Replication is the most important statistic. If an experimental effect does not replicateóeither in your own lab or independentlyóthen trust in that effect should rightly diminish. Thus, assessing the reproducibility of an effect should rightly be among the priorities of psychological scientists. Despite the importance, replication attempts in psychology are rare, likely due to the enhanced incentive (e.g. publications, grant income) to introduce new ideas to the field rather than assess the validity of old ones.</description>
