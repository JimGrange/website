      <description>In 2015, I published my first ever R package: “trimr: An implementation of common response time trimming methods”. To date, this package has had over 5,600 downloads from CRAN, which is unbelievable!
3 years is a long time for a package, so I thought it was time to update the package, fix some bugs, and implement some additional functionality. To this end, I have spent some time over the past few days working on a new release.</description>
